days turns into weeks,
And weeks into years,
I keep thinking one day I will
Say it my dear!

In my heart in my head,
Ilove you so much but I wish I told you Instead !!
life is passing us all by !
Emotions we hide and sometimes feel shy!
why o why !!!
Let's change or let's at least try !!

say it now and say it often,
Don't allow your feeling to be forgotten!
listen to your heart's desire,
They will lead you to a treasure that all admire !

Hugs would be warmer,
laughs would be louder,
kisses more passionate,
If only we realise that tomorrow
It might just be a little late !

Time is running out my dear
Make that call and never fear!
Love is less no matter how much we share!
say it now oh please don't despair !!

I make a vow and make it now,
I will never wait for that tomorrow !
In my heart and in my head,
I love you so much but now I am saying it instead !!

All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts.

i love you my son

every moment is a fresh beginning
