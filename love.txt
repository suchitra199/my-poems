shining in your eyes
make me feel so deep
your lips and chicks
i would like to sip

your little finger so sensitive 
which i like to feel
frame of your hand 
i hope that my hand will fit
your hair, i would like to smell
your fragnance, make my heart floweret
your presence 
would melt me without heat

Now if I stand so close and watch
how beautiful you are,
behold, I would not last without
surrend'ring to you kiss..

To be, or not to be: that is the question

shinchan shinchan pyara pyara
